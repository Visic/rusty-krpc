		This can be used to interact with a specific part module. This includes part modules in
		stock KSP, and those added by mods.
		
		In KSP, each part has zero or more PartModules
		associated with it. Each one contains some of the functionality of the part.
		For example, an engine has a "ModuleEngines" part module that contains all the
		functionality of an engine.
